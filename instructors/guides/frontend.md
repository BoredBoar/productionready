# Frontend Instructor Guide

This guide will provide you with the necessary knowledge & resources required for teaching a **frontend web framework** (React, Angular2, Ember, etc) that integrates with ProductionReady.

The process of creating a frontend course is done in three steps:

1. Build the entire application
2. Break up the completed codebase into step-by-step checkpoints
3. Write the course

## Build the application

### 1. Set up your initial github repo
The first thing you'll want to do is set up a github repo. Fork this repo, place your code in the `code` folder.

### 2. Start building your app


#### Avoid using unnecessary build tools/transpilers
By default, avoid using any build tools/transpilers that aren't absolutely necessary. don't go overboard. use bare minimum to get people started, otherwise it can become incredibly confusing. only exception is when it's a focal point of the course itself (i.e. "Build ES6 Angular 1.x apps" would likely require an ES6 transpiler). save your epic build tool optimizations for future posts :)

#### TDD is _not_ required
Considering these courses are largely targeting intermediate developers, we think that TDD implementations should be covered in supplementary courses. As such, if you want to include tests with the codebase you're more than welcome to, but it's not required.

#### Use our courses
bootstrap styles/templates (explain NPM versioning)
default profile image
API spec, live server to test on
no TDD



Examples:

React - use Webpack/Babel, but don't implement niceties such as x,y,z
Angular -
