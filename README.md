> Learn how to build fullstack apps with React, Angular, Node, Rails, Django, and more

### [Website](http://)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Course](http://)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Mailing list](http://)

Most tutorials only cover trivial examples like "todo" apps and rarely show real world interactions between a frontend and a backend. Even if they do, they don't let you mix & match your ideal frontend and backend nor is the code they have you write appropriate for production environments. Piecing together your stack is just a painful, hairy process.

To solve this problem, we created a series of production ready frontend & backend tutorials (with accompanying codebases) that can be mixed & matched. Every tutorial teaches you how to build Conduit [(demo)](https://demo.productionready.io), a fully featured social blogging platform, from scratch. The tutorials also teach you best practices & expert protips for each stack as well as how to deploy it to production environments on AWS, Heroku, and more.

*Each tutorial can be taken separately from one another. Or you can combine any frontend, backend and deployment tutorial to create a production fullstack app. It's up to you!*

## How this works

Every tutorial is built against the same API spec and every frontend shares the same exact Bootstrap 4 templates.

The source code for all stacks is available in this repo in the stacks folder. The text of the tutorials are available for free on Thinkster.

- same api
- same bootstrap design
- pricing
