> Learn how to build fullstack apps with React / Redux, Angular, Node, Rails, Django, and more

### [Website](http://)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Course](http://)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Mailing list](http://)

Most tutorials only cover simple examples like "todo" apps and rarely show you how to build real world, production ready fullstack apps. They certainly don't cover actually deploying your applications into a production environment either. Worse yet, the only way developers can solve this right now is to piece together disparate tutorials from across the web that are completely disjointed and often incompatible with one another.

Suffice it to say, learning fullstack development is a painful, hairy process.

To solve this problem, we worked with OSS community leaders to create a series of frontend, backend and deployment tutorials that can be mixed & matched (the backends all create the same API & the frontends use the same UI templates/styles). Every tutorial teaches you how to build Conduit [(demo)](https://demo.productionready.io), a beautifully designed and fully featured social blogging platform, from scratch. The tutorials also teach you best practices & expert protips for each stack as well as how to deploy it to production environments on AWS, Heroku, and more.

*Each tutorial can be taken separately from one another. Or you can combine any frontend, backend and deployment tutorial to create a production fullstack app. It's up to you!*

## How this works

- Every tutorial is built against the same [API spec](http://) to ensure modularity of every frontend & backend 
- Every frontend utilizes the same hand crafted [Bootstrap 4 theme](http://) for identical UI/UX
- The **[text of the tutorials](http://) are available for free** on [Thinkster](http://)
- Screencasts & other supplementary resources are available and **support the ongoing development of ProductionReady**, so please consider investing in [a Pro subscription](http://) to supercharge your learning!
- Whilst we enjoy implementing and improving existing stacks, we're always interested in helping provide resources to framework authors (and users) wishing to share app implementations in their framework/solution of choice. [Read our "Getting involved" docs  &rarr;](http://)

## Running the stacks locally

The source code for all stacks is available in this repo in the stacks folder. Simply `git pull --with-submodules` and then follow the instructions in each stack's readme.


## Who made this?

ProductionReady wouldn't be possible without the help of the open source community reviewing codebases, creating new app implementations, and many other tasks that help push this project forward. We especially appreciate the OSS leaders who have helped build the various stacks supported on ProductionReady, and we're [currently looking to provide funding to more OSS creators](http://) for their work.

**In addition, the core creators are [Eric Simons](https://twitter.com/ericsimons40) and [Albert Pai](https://twitter.com/iamalbertpai)** &mdash; childhood best friends and cofounders of [Thinkster.io](https://thinkster.io). Thinkster funds this entire project, so please consider investing in [a Pro subscription](http://) to **support the ongoing development of ProductionReady**!

In particular, we'd like to thank a few folks who have been instrumental in guiding & inspiring this project:

- **Dan Abramov** (creator of Redux) for [sparking the initial idea](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/692009757775896577), [helping us find an author](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/issues/1353) as well as graciously taking the time to provide feedback on [Val](https://github.com/vkarpov15/)'s React+Redux codebase
- **Max Lynch** (creator of Ionic) for taking the time to provide guidance in the early days of this project
- **Addy Osmani & the rest of the TodoMVC team**
- **James Brewer** for countless brainstorming sessions, helping name this project, and creating the Django codebase + tutorial
