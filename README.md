> Learn how to build fullstack apps with React / Redux, Angular, Node, Rails, Django, and more

### [Website](http://)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Course](http://)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Mailing list](http://)

Most tutorials only cover trivial examples like "todo" apps and rarely show real world interactions between a frontend and a backend. Even if they do, they don't let you mix & match your ideal frontend and backend nor is the code they have you write appropriate for production environments. Piecing together your stack is just a painful, hairy process.

To solve this problem, we created a series of production ready frontend & backend tutorials (with accompanying codebases) that can be mixed & matched. Every tutorial teaches you how to build Conduit [(demo)](https://demo.productionready.io), a fully featured social blogging platform, from scratch. The tutorials also teach you best practices & expert protips for each stack as well as how to deploy it to production environments on AWS, Heroku, and more.

*Each tutorial can be taken separately from one another. Or you can combine any frontend, backend and deployment tutorial to create a production fullstack app. It's up to you!*

## How this works

- Every tutorial is built against the same [API spec](http://) to ensure modularity of every frontend & backend 
- Every frontend utilizes the same hand crafted [Bootstrap 4 theme](http://) for identical UI/UX
- The [text of the tutorials](http://) are available to use **for free** on [Thinkster](http://)
- Screencasts & other supplementary resources are available and support the ongoing development of ProductionReady, so please consider investing in [a Pro subscription](http://)!

## Hosted API
We have a hosted version of the API that is publicly available and doesn't require an API key to use. It's **perfect for OSS demos**. [Learn more >](http://)
