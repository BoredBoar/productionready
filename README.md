Building a production ready fullstack app is insanely difficult. You have to choose a frontend, a backend, a deployment host... but worse yet, you have to figure out how to make all of those work together.

Most tutorials only cover trivial examples like "todo" apps and rarely show real world interactions between a frontend and a backend. Even if they do, they don't let you mix & match your ideal frontend and backend nor is the code they have you write appropriate for production environments. Piecing together your stack is just a painful, hairy process.

To solve this problem, we created a series of tutorials (with accompanying codebases) that can be mixed & matched. Every tutorial teaches you how to build Conduit [(demo)](https://demo.productionready.io), a fully featured social blogging platform, from scratch. You'll learn best practices & expert protips for your stack and how to deploy it to production environments on AWS, Heroku, and more.
